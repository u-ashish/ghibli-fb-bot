# ghibli-fb-bot

Got bored one night and made a chatbot to talk to about information on Studio Ghibli movies. Mostly to practice writing something with Node.JS, and understanding how to work with FB chat bots. 

Uses NodeJS, Heroku, MongoDB, and a random Studio Ghibli API which you can find here: https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com

At the time of writing this, no API key was required.
